Born Omar Banos, Cuco first began playing music at the age of 8 years old and quickly learned guitar, bass, keys, drums, trumpet, french horn, and mellophone all before 15. After teaching himself Ableton at 16, Cuco was eager to start independently releasing his own music once finishing high school. In Summer of 2016, Cuco released his first mixtape Wannabewithu -- a collection of teenage heartbreak over abstract chords, lo fi synths, ambient guitars, punchy drums, and lead trumpets that resonated with thousands of music lovers everywhere. The release of his first bilingual track "
				  Lo Que Siento " has moved the needle tremendously with over 9.6 million Spotify streams and counting. With his debut album currently in the works and a busy 2018 touring schedule ahead, it's looking like a life-altering year for Hawthorne's Cuco.">

Working under the tutelage of the OVO Sound family, his debut EP Exis has earned millions of spins from around the world, debuting at #10 on the R&B Billboard Charts.

Emotional and raw – the Toronto artist possesses a supreme yet inviting confidence. A young artist filled with an almost reckless passion, his James Dean-esque demeanor speaks authentically to a generation and is captured and felt within every song and visual. You can hear the explosive energy that shines crystal clear through his soulful voice today, one that he inherited from his mother, who would sing and play Motown records around the house all day when he was young.

Roy’s music has earned serious conversation amongst his musical peers and established industry legends including Drake, who signed him in 2015. With soaring vocals that lift listeners into private worlds of emotion and desire, Roy Woods has become a global phenomenon. Freshly off tour with Drake & Future on Summer Sixteen and with a brand new project called “Waking At Dawn” out now– Roy Woods is ready to unlock the underground and unleash his gospel of personal truths onto the world.">

Influenced by the foreign culture around him and inspired by his brother Rizzy (a successful rapper in his own right) MadeinTYO began to take music seriously. He uploaded a song to his brother's page and a movement was born.
So far, armed with mostly with a batch of songs scattered across SoundCloud and some online videos to his name, MadeinTYO has managed to carve out a spot for himself amongst Future, Young Thug, and Migos in the crowded Atlanta hip-hop scene. His bass-heavy production is sonically right in line with the street sensibilities of the south but his style is more playful and breezy than most of his contemporaries.
